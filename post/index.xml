      <title>The Many Uses of Schedulers</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you don&amp;rsquo;t have unlimited resources. Be it RAM, access to files, CPU slots, whatever you can think of. And then you have multiple workloads that will need said resources. That&amp;rsquo;s where scheduling comes in. Scheduling comes in MANY shapes and sizes including ones you haven&amp;rsquo;t even suspected of.
Scheduler types Here we explore the various scheduler algorithms that deal with scheduling tasks. Keep in mind I also tried to unify the terminology used so a task forms a unit of work that scheduler schedules.</description>

      <description>Full disclosure: This game is amazing, you should try it. It&amp;rsquo;s probably on discount on GOG.
BUT this is getting out of hand. I was just about to stop playing and then the game unlocked this ninja sword guy and I had to play it all over again.
Let&amp;rsquo;s give it a month and we&amp;rsquo;ll revisit.</description>

      <description>Packages arrived. I finally have everything I need to start the project. Behold the Raspberry PI Zero!
Actually I got panicked a bit since I suddenly realized &amp;ldquo;Hold on. How do I communicate with this??&amp;quot;. Then I remembered my dusty, but still working CP2102 so there we are:
Note: btw the white thing below the UART console is the Alcatel from my previous post.
This is probably going to turn into a long series of posts so I&amp;rsquo;m going to come up with a name soon.</description>

      <description>Well that post simply exploded! Never thought so many people would be interested in this topic. The thread is a treasure trove for mobile communications knowledge.
Check it out.
In other news ordered an Alcatel with &amp;ldquo;official Linux support&amp;rdquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what comes out of it. Updates to come soon.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I asked about open hardware platforms/products for modems that can connect to 3G/4G netwroks in a dongle format.
And what do you know, basically nothing came up hardware-wise. Apparently BIG CORP &amp;amp; CO.â„¢ has an extremely tight grip on the entire affair and everything is riddled with patents and license fees.
This saddens me a little since it could&amp;rsquo;ve helped with an upcoming project, but alas I&amp;rsquo;ll have to do with one of the ordinary modems on the market right now.</description>

      <description>The other day in HN land this one took off as a fire storm:

 Quite unsurprising to be honest. Many people have been hurt by the unending complexity and choose-your-own-adventure process that is hiring.
And I don&amp;rsquo;t see it changing any time soon. For one software ate the world, but not everything in the world is so great to be eaten.</description>

      <description>Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting a bunch of stuff here I&amp;rsquo;m interested in.
I built it using the awesome Hugo generator with a slightly modded Even theme. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how long this one lasts.</description>
