        <p>One nice thing about having your own IBM Personal Computer is that
          it's <i>yours</i>. For your business, your project, your department, your
          class, your family and, indeed, for yourself.</p>
        <p>Of course, you might have thought owning a computer was too
          expensive. But now you can relax.</p>
        <p>The IBM Personal Computer starts at less than $1,600 for a system
           that, with the addition of one simple device, hooks up to your home TV
           and uses your audio cassette recorder.</p>
        <p>You might also have thought running a computer was too difficult. But
           you can relax again.</p>

        <p>Getting started is easier than you might think, because IBM has
          structured the learning process for you. Our literature is in <i>your</i>
          language, not in “computerese.“ Our software <i>involves</i> you, the system
          <i>interacts</i> with you as if it was made to - and it was.</p>
          <p>That's why you can be running programs in just one day. Maybe even
            writing your <i>own</i> programs in a matter of weeks.</p>
            <p>For ease of use, flexibility and performance, no other personal
              computer offers as many advanced capabilities. (See the box.)</p>
              <p>But what makes the IBM Personal Computer a truly useful tool are
                software programs selected by IBM's Personal Computer Software
                Publishing Department. You can have programs in business,
                professional, word processing, computer language, personal and
                entertainment categories.</p>
                <p>You can see the system and the software in action at any Computer
                  Land" store or Sears Business Systems Center. Or try it out at one of
                  our IBM Product Centers. The IBM Data Processing Division will serve
                  those customers who want to purchase in quantity.
                </p>
                <p><i>Your</i> IBM Personal Computer. Once you start working with it, you'll
                  discover more than the answers and solutions you seek: you'll discover
                  that getting there is half the fun. Imagine that.
