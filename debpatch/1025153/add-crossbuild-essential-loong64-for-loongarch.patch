+Description: Informational list of cross-build-essential packages
+ If you do not plan to cross build Debian packages, you don't need
+ this package.  Starting with sbuild (>= 0.63.0) this package is
+ required for cross building Debian packages in a chroot.
+ .
+ This package contains an informational list of packages which are
+ considered essential for cross building Debian packages.  This
+ package also depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to
+ have the cross-build-essential packages installed.
+ .
+ If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
+ a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to cross build the
+ package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
+ to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
+ package depends on.
