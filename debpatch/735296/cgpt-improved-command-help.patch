+Cgpt is a tool to manipulate a GUID Partition Table from the command line. Although several other utilities exist for the same basic purpose \- some with more features and a captive user interface \- cgpt is unique in that it also supports Chromium OS extensions. These extensions are not generally useful; they are specific to the u-boot firmware found on some Chromebooks. They may be used to change priority for kernel partitions and give other hints to u-boot Chromebook firmware. Use this utility only to manipulate a partition table for compatible Chromebooks.
+
+.SH COMMANDS
+Each action performed by this program \- with the notable exception of the \fI\-h\fR \fIOPTION\fR \- is initiated by a command which tells cgpt the type of operation to perform. All available commands are described below.
+
+.IP \fBcreate\fR
+Create or reset GPT headers and tables.
+
+.IP \fBadd\fR
+Add, edit, or remove a partition entry.
+
+This command requires a minimum of three options to do anything useful. See the \fICREATE OPTIONS\fR section for details.
+
+.IP \fBshow\fR
+Show the partition table and entries.
+
+.IP \fBrepair\fR
+Repair damaged GPT headers and tables.
+
+.IP \fBboot\fR
+Edit the PMBR sector for legacy BIOSes.
+
+If no \fIBOOT OPTIONS\fR are specified, this command will just print the PMBR boot GUID.
+
+.IP \fBfind\fR
+Find a partition by its UUID or label.
+
+If no \fIDRIVE\fR is specified, this command will scan all physical drives for a match.
+
+.IP \fBprioritize\fR
+Reorder the priority of all ChromeOS kernel partitions.
+
+If no options are specified, this command will set the lowest active kernel to priority 1 while maintaining the original order.
+
+.IP \fBlegacy\fR
+Switch between GPT and Legacy GPT.
+
+.SH GENERAL\ OPTIONS
+The options described in this section apply to every \fICOMMAND\fR supported by this program.
+
+.IP \fB-h\fR
+For more detailed usage, use \fBcgpt\fR \fICOMMAND\fR \fI-h\fR
+
+.SH CREATE\ OPTIONS
+The options described in this section apply only to the \fIcreate\fR \fICOMMAND\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-z\fR
+Zero the sectors of the GPT table and its entries.
+
+.SH ADD\ OPTIONS
+The options described in this section apply only to the \fIadd\fR \fICOMMAND\fR.
+
+Use the \fI-i\fR option to modify an existing partition. The \fI-b\fR, \fI-s\fR, and \fI-t\fR options must be given for new partitions.
+
+.IP \fB-i\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+Add the partition as number \fINUM\fR. The default, when this option is not used, is to use the next available partition number.
+
+.IP \fB-b\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+The partition should start at sector \fINUM\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-s\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+The partition should occupy \fINUM\fR sectors. This is the effective partition size, in sectors.
+
+.IP \fB-t\fR\ \fIGUID\fR
+Add a new \fIGUID\fR type partition.

+
+.IP \fB-u\fR\ \fIGUID\fR
+Assign the new partition \fIGUID\fR as its Partition Unique ID.
+
+.IP \fB-l\fR\ \fILABEL\fR
+Give the partition the label \fILABEL\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-S\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+Set the firmware "Successful" flag. \fINUM\fR must be either 0 or 1.
+
+.IP \fB-T\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+Set the firmware "Tries" flag. \fINUM\fR must be between 0 and 15 (inclusive).
+
+.IP \fB-P\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+Set the firmware "Priority" flag. \fINUM\fR must be between 0 and 15 (inclusive).
+
+.IP \fB-A\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+Set an aribtrary attribute value. \fINUM\fR must be a raw 64-bit integer.
+
+.SH SHOW\ OPTIONS
+The options described in this section apply only to the \fIshow\fR \fICOMMAND\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-n\fR
+Display numeric output only.
+
+.IP \fB-v\fR
+Be much more verbose in the partition table output.
+
+.IP \fB-q\fR
+Prefer quick output over the greater level of detail usually printed.
+
+.IP \fB-i\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+Show partition \fINUM\fR only. The partition may be selected using one of the following flags. For more detailed information on each flag, see the equivalent flag's description in the \fIADD OPTIONS\fR section.

+
+.SH REPAIR\ OPTIONS
+The options described in this section apply only to the \fIrepair\fR \fICOMMAND\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-v\fR
+Print extra partition table repair details.
+
+.SH BOOT\ OPTIONS
+The options described in this section apply only to the \fIboot\fR \fICOMMAND\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-i\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+Set partition \fINUM\fR as a bootable partition. This command merely sets the flag; it does not actually install a bootloader or do anything else to make the partition bootable.
+
+.IP \fB-b\fR\ \fIFILE\fR
+Install the bootloader code contained in the binary file \fIFILE\fR in the Protected Master Boot Record (PMBR). This code should be no larger than the PMBR (or you risk damaging the partition table).
+
+.IP \fB-p\fR
+Create a legacy Protected Master Boot Record (PMBR) Partition Table. PMBR is a compatibility feature for legacy support only. It must be synchronized with the GUID Partition Table (GPT) each time you make changes to a partition's constraints. Only use this feature if you absolutely need it.
+
+.SH FIND\ OPTIONS
+The options described in this section apply only to the \fIfind\fR \fICOMMAND\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-t\fR\ \fIGUID\fR
+Search for a \fIGUID\fR type partition. Valid partition types are enumerated under the \fI-t\fR \fIOPTION\fR in the \fIADD OPTIONS\fR section.
+
+.IP \fB-u\fR\ \fIGUID\fR
+Search for a partition using \fIGUID\fR as its Partition Unique ID.
+
+.IP \fB-l\fR\ \fILABEL\fR
+Search for a partition with the label \fILABEL\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-v\fR
+Be verbose in displaying matches. The output will get progressively more verbose the more times this option is specified (to a point).
+
+.IP \fB-n\fR
+Display numeric output only.
+
+.IP \fB-1\fR
+Fail if more than one match is found.
+
+.IP \fB-M\fR\ \fIFILE\fR
+Matching partitions must also contain the content in the binary file \fIFILE\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-O\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+If \fI-M\fR is specified, start matching \fIFILE\fR's contents at the byte offset \fINUM\fR into the partition. By default (if this option is not specified), data is matched from the beginning of the partition (\fI-O\fR 0).
+
+.SH PRIORITIZE\ OPTIONS
+The options described in this section apply only to the \fIprioritize\fR \fICOMMAND\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-P\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+Set \fINUM\fR as the highest priority in the new ordering. The other partitions will be ranked in decreasing priority while preserving their original order. The lowest ranks will be coalesced, if necessary; no active kernels will be lowered to priority 0.
+
+.IP \fB-i\fR\ \fINUM\fR
+Make partition \fINUM\fR the highest priority partition in the new order.
+
+.IP \fB-f\fR
+Give friends of the specified partition (those with the same starting priority) the new highest priority as well.
+
+.SH LEGACY\ OPTIONS
+The options described in this section apply only to the \fIlegacy\fR \fICOMMAND\fR.
+
+.IP \fB-e\fR
+Switch the GPT header signature back to "EFI PART". By default the GPT header signature will be switched to "CHROMEOS".
+
+.SH DRIVE
+Perform the specified operations on \fIDRIVE\fR. \fIDRIVE\fR should be a block device (typically /dev/sd[a-z] or /dev/mmcblk[0-9]) or a raw file representing a disk image.
+
