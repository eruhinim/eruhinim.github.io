 It sets the shared key challenge length, which can be anything from 16 to 1480. The default is 128 bytes. It is the number of bytes used in the random challenge. Since one tag can contain a maximum size of 255 bytes, any value above 255 creates several challenge tags until all specified bytes are written. Many clients ignore values different than 128 bytes so this option may not always work.

-Airbase-ng also contains the new caffe-latte attack, which is also implemented in aireplay-ng as attack "-6". It can be used with "-L" or "caffe-latte". This attack specifically works against clients, as it waits for a broadcast arp request, which happens to be a gratuitous arp. See this for an explaination of what a gratuitous arp is. It then flips a few bits in the sender MAC and IP, corrects the ICV (crc32) value and sends it back to the client, where it came from. The point why this attack works in practice is, that at least windows sends gratuitous arps after a connection on layer 2 is established and a static ip is set, or dhcp fails and windows assigned an IP out of 169.254.X.X.

 "-x <pps>" sets the number of packets per second to send when performing the caffe-latte attack. At the moment, this attack doesn't stop, it continuously sends arp requests. Airodump-ng is needed to capture the replys.
