 ==== Email basics
 
 An http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email[email] message consists of three components, the message envelope, the message header, and the message body.
 
-The "To" and "From" information in the message envelope is used by the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol[SMTP] to deliver the email. (The "From" information in the message envelope is also called http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_address[bounce address], From_, etc.)
+The "To" and "From" information in the message envelope is used by the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol[SMTP] to deliver the email. (The "From" information in the message envelope is also called http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_address[bounce address], From_, etc.).
 
+### HW: in this sentence you talk of "email clients", but in the whole rest of the chapter
+### HW: you call it MUA or mail user agent. No more reference of "email client".
+### HW: This can be considered inconsistent and may confuse users?
 The "To" and "From" information in the message header is displayed by the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client[email client]. (While it is most common for these to be the same as ones in the message envelope, such is not always the case.)
 
 The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client[email client] needs to interpret the message header and body data using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME[Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)] to deal the content data type and encoding.
 
 ==== Modern mail service basics
 
-In order to contain spam (unwanted and unsolicited email) problems, many ISPs which provide consumer grade Internet connections are implementing counter measures.
+### HW: "contain" does not make sense here IMHO. I think s/contain/avoid is what you want.

 ==== The mail configuration strategy for workstation
 
-The most simple mail configuration is that the mail is sent to the ISP@@@sq@@@s smarthost and received from ISP@@@sq@@@s POP3 server by the MUA (see <<_mail_user_agent_mua>>) itself. This type of configuration is popular with full featured GUI based MUA such as `icedove`(1), `evolution`(1), etc. If you need to filter mail by their types, you use MUA@@@sq@@@s filtering function. For this case, the local MTA (see <<_mail_transport_agent_mta>>) need to do local delivery only.

+### HW: so this does not happen for me." In the light of this they might 
+### HW: misunderstand the above sentence. That's why I would make it more clearer.
 
 The alternative mail configuration is that the mail is sent via local MTA to the ISP@@@sq@@@s smarthost and received from ISP@@@sq@@@s POP3 by the mail retriever (see <<_the_remote_mail_retrieval_and_forward_utility>>) to the local mailbox.  If you need to filter mail by their types, you use MDA with filter (see <<_mail_delivery_agent_mda_with_filter>>) to filter mail into separate mailboxes.  This type of configuration is popular with simple console based MUA such as `mutt`(1), `mew`(1), etc., although this is possible with any MUAs (see <<_mail_user_agent_mua>>). For this case, the local MTA (see <<_mail_transport_agent_mta>>) need to do both smarthost delivery and local delivery.  Since mobile workstation does not have valid FQDN, you must configure the local MTA to hide and spoof the real local mail name in outgoing mail to avoid mail delivery errors (see <<_the_mail_address_configuration>>).

 Although `fetchmail`(1) has been de facto standard for the remote mail retrieval on GNU/Linux, the author likes `getmail`(1) now.  If you want to reject mail before downloading to save bandwidth, `mailfilter` or `mpop` may be useful.  Whichever mail retriever utilities are used, it is a good idea to configure system to deliver retrieved mails to MDA, such as `maildrop`, via pipe.
