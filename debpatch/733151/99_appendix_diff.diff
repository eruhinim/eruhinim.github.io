 === The Debian maze
 
-The Linux system is a very powerful computing platform for a networked computer.  However, learning how to use all its capabilities is not easy. Setting up the LPR printer with non-PostScript printer was a good example of stumble points. (There are no issues anymore since newer installations use new CUPS system.)

 There is a complete, detailed map called the "SOURCE CODE".  This is very accurate but very hard to understand.  There are also references called HOWTO and mini-HOWTO.  They are easier to understand but tend to give too much
 detail and lose the big picture.  I sometimes have a problem finding the right section in a long HOWTO when I need a few commands to invoke.

 === Copyright history
 
 Debian Reference was initiated by Osamu Aoki <osamu at debian dot org> as a personal system administration memo. Many contents came from the knowledge I gained from http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/[the debian-user mailing list] and other Debian resources.
+### HW: this paragraph before seems weird to me: first you talk in the third person
+### HW: ("initiated by Osamu") and then suddenly in the first person ("Many contents came 
+### HW: from the knowledge I gained from"). Of course, this situation can be found
+### HW: in other places in the DR as well, and it would be too much work to sync that,
+### HW: but in this case, where it appears directly together, it could/should be solved?
+### HW: Like this:
+### HW: "The Debian Reference was initiated by me, Osamu Aoki <osamu at debian dot org>, as a ... "
+### HW:  ^^^ 
+### HW: "The" added as well
 
 Following a suggestion from Josip Rodin, who was very active with the http://www.debian.org/doc/ddp[Debian Documentation Project (DDP)], "Debian Reference (version 1, 2001-2007)" was created as a part of DDP documents.
 
-After 6 years, Osamu realized that the original "Debian Reference (version 1)" was outdated and started to rewrite many contents.  New "Debian Reference (version 2)" is released in 2008.

 === Document format
 
 The source of the English original document is currently written in http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=asciidoc[AsciiDoc] text files.  http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=asciidoc[AsciiDoc] is used as convenience only since it is less typing than straight XML and supports table in the very intuitive format.  You should think XML and PO files as real source files.  Via build script, it is converted to DocBook XML format and automatically generated data are inserted to form a final Docbook XML source. This final Docbook XML source can be converted to HTML, plain text, PostScript, and PDF. Currently, only HTML and plain text conversions are enabled.
+### HW: mention epub format as well?
