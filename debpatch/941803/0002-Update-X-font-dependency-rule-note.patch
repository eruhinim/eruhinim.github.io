Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Update X font dependency rule note
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

X fonts are still not in the remit of the Debian packaging system
only, but the font server justification isnât relevant nowadays. The
use of remote X servers is still relevant, and has always been a
reason for the rule that packages must not depend on X font packages,
since fonts are provided by the server.
