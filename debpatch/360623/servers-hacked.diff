 Network Operations Center (NOC) caught fire.  The building burnt
 to the ground.  The fire department gave up hope on
 protecting the server area.  Among other things the NOC hosted
 satie.debian.org which contained both the security and non-US archive
 as well as the new-maintainer (nm) and quality assurance (qa)
 databases.  Debian rebuilt these services on the host klecker, which
 was recently moved from the U.S.A. to the Netherlands.
