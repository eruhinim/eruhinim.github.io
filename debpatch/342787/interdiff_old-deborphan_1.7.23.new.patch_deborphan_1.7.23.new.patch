+  * Fixed --show-deps, some user packages would show up twice

+  * added --removable option:
+     "Find packages that can *individually* be removed
+      without triggering other removals. (implies nice-mode OFF).
+      They may be used, but other packages in the system
+      provide the same functionality, so they can be removed as
+      long as these other packages are there.
+      As these other packages may also be in the list, it may not
+      be possible to remove returned packages as a group
+      (deborphan --removable should be re-run after each removal).
+      On the other hand, it allows to find orphans which would not
+      be listed without --removable."
