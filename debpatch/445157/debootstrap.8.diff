-.IP "\fB\-\-no\-resolve\-deps\fP"
-By default, debootstrap will attempt to automatically resolve any missing
-dependencies, warning if any are found. Note that this is not a complete

-to specify the entire base system than rely on this option. With this
-option set, this behaviour is disabled.
-.IP
-.IP "\fB\-\-variant=buildd|fakechroot\fP"
-Name of the bootstrap script variant to use.  Currently, the variant
-supported are buildd, which installs the build-essential packages into
-.IR TARGET
-and fakechroot, which installs the packages without root privileges.
-The default, with no \fB\-\-variant=X\fP argument, is to create a base
