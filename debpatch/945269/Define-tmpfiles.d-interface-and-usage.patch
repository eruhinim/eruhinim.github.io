+Packages might need additional files or directories to implement their
+functionality. Directories that are located under ``/var/`` or ``/etc/``, and
+files that are located under ``/var/``, should not be created manually via
+maintainer scripts, but instead be declaratively defined via the `tmpfiles.d
+<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html>`_ interface.
+The ``tmpfiles.d`` file format is defined by the ``systemd`` project, and is
+guaranteed to be stable. Ideally, such definitions should be defined upstream
+where applicable, and shipped as they are by Debian packages.
+
+Details about the syntax and installation paths for ``tmpfiles.d`` are defined
+by its `reference implementation's documentation,
+<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/tmpfiles.d.html>`_ and will
+not be redefined here.
+
+``tmpfiles.d`` snippets should be usable on systems that do not boot (such as a
+very minimal chroot image), and also systems booting with init systems other
+than ``systemd``.
+
+``tmpfiles.d`` snippets should be detected at package build time by tools such
+as ``debhelper``, packaged, and the appropriate snippet to call them on
+installation, upgrade, removal, purge and other steps as required, should be
+automatically added by helpers such as ``dh_installtmpfiles``, including the
+required dependency on the appropriate ``tmpfiles.d`` implementation, while also
+ensuring that such dependency can be satisfied on minimal systems that are not
+bootable. The ``systemd-tmpfiles`` virtual package will ensure a binary package
+providing tools that conform to the reference implementation will be installed.
+
+Init systems are required to integrate with ``tmpfiles.d`` and run the service
+that applies them on boot, and regularly for cleanup purposes. The documentation
+for the reference implementation, `systemd-tmpfiles,
+<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-tmpfiles.html>`_
+explains how to call the program so that the appropriate ``tmpfiles.d`` snippets
+are applied at the appropriate time.
