-msgid "The first question deals with the type of setup. Only two of the proposed answers are relevant in case of an Internet-connected server, âInternet siteâ and âInternet with smarthostâ. The former is appropriate for a server that receives incoming email and sends outgoing email directly to its recipients, and is therefore well-adapted to the Falcot Corp case. The latter is appropriate for a server receiving incoming email nomally, but that sends outgoing email through an intermediate SMTP server â the âsmarthostâ â rather than directly to the recipient's server. This is mostly useful for individuals with a dynamic IP address, since many email servers reject messages coming straight from such an IP address.
