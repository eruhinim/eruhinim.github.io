+colord (1.4.6-2.2) unstable; urgency=medium
+
+  * Non-maintainer upload
+
+  [ Debian Janitor ]
+  * d/copyright: Refer to common license file for CC0-1.0
+  * d/control: Use secure URI in Homepage field
+  * d/colord.maintscript: Remove obsolete maintscript entries
+  * d/colord.preinst: Remove empty maintainer script
+
+  [ Simon McVittie ]
+  * d/control: Depend on polkitd | policykit-1, not just policykit-1.
+    This allows colord to be installed without pulling in the transitional
+    package policykit-1, which in turn is enough to avoid policykit-1 being
+    included in new bookworm installations of GNOME, KDE Plasma and Xfce.
+    (Closes: #1025554, #1025379)
+  * d/tests/installed-tests: Fix autopkgtest failure if polkitd-pkla is
+    not installed.
+    Installing policykit-1 is no longer guaranteed to provide support for
+    the legacy .pkla rules language.
+  * d/control: Build-depend on libjson-glib-dev.
+    This works around a missing dependency by libgusb-dev (see #1032183)
+    and can be reverted when that bug is fixed.

- Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal

- LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
- ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
- ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
- USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND
- DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT
- OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
- .
- Statement of Purpose
- .
- The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
- exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
- and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
- of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
- .
- Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
- the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
- scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
- fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
- other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
- whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
- purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
- ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
- and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
- their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
- .
- For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
- expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
- associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
- she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
- elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
- its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
- the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those
- rights.
- .
- 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
- protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
- Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
- limited to, the following:
- .
- i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
- communicate, and translate a Work;
- .
- ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
- .
- iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
- likeness depicted in a Work;
- .
- iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
- subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
- .
- v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
- data in a Work;
- .
- vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
- the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
- protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
- including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
- .
- vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
- world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
- implementations thereof.
- .
- 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
- of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
- irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
- Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
- of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
- future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
- worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
- treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
- future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
- whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
- promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the
- benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of
- Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall
- not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
- any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of
- the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement
- of Purpose.
- .
- 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
- be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
- Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
- account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
- extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
- person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non
- exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's
- Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories
- worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
- treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
- future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
- whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
- promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed
- effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should
- any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
- ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
- ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and
- in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
- exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
- Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with
- respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express
- Statement of Purpose.
- .
- 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
- .
- a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
- surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
- .
- b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
- warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
- or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
- merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
- the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
- absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
- extent permissible under applicable law.
- .
- c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
- persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
- limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
- Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
- consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
- .
- d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
- party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
- this CC0 or use of the Work.
