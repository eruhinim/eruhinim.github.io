+Epiphany and NetworkManager
+---------------------------
+
+Epiphany uses NetworkManager to detect an active network
+connection. If NetworkManager isn't set up correctly and doesn't
+detect the network, this might result in Epiphany starting in offline
+mode, or randomly going offline.
+
+To correct this, either set up NetworkManager correctly by following
+the documentation in /usr/share/doc/network-manager or disable this
+functionality in Epiphany by setting the gconf key
+/apps/epiphany/general/managed_network to false.
