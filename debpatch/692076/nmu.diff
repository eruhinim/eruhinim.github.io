-
-NAME
-       catdoc - reads MS-Word file and puts its content as plain text on stanâ
-       dard output
-
-SYNOPSIS
-       catdoc [-vlu8btawxV] [-m number] [ -s charset] [ -d charset] [ -f  outâ
-       put-format] file
-
-
-DESCRIPTION
-       catdoc  behaves much like cat(1) but it reads MS-Word file and produces
-       human-readable text on standard output.  Optionally it can use latex(1)
-       escape  sequences  for characters which have special meaning for LaTeX.
-       It also makes some effort to  recognize  MS-Word  tables,  although  it
-       never  tries  to  write  correct headers for LaTeX tabular environment.
-       Additional output formats, such is HTML can be easily defined.
-
-       catdoc doesn't attempt to extract  formatting  information  other  than
-       tables  from  MS-Word  document, so different output modes means mainly
-       that different characters should be escaped and different ways used  to
-       represent  characters,  missing from output charset. See CHARACTER SUBâ
-       STITUTION below
-
-
-       catdoc uses internal unicode(7) representation of text, so it  is  able
-       to  convert texts when charset in source document doesn't match charset
-       on target system.  See CHARACTER SETS below.
-
-       If no file names supplied, catdoc processes its standard  input  unless
-       it  is  terminal. It is unlikely that somebody could type Word document
-       from keyboard, so if catdoc invoked without arguments and stdin is  not
-       redirected,  it  prints  brief  usage message and exits.  Processing of
-       standard input (even among other files) can be forced using dash '-' as
-       file name.
-
-       By  default,  catdoc  wraps lines which are more than 72 chars long and
-       separates paragraphs by blank lines. This behavior can be turned of  by
-       -w  switch. In wide mode catdoc prints each paragraph as one long line,
-       suitable for import into word processors which perform word wrapping.
-
-
-
-OPTIONS
-       -a      - shortcut for -f ascii. Produces ASCII text as output.   Sepaâ
-               rates table columns with TAB
-
-       -b      - process broken MS-Word file. Normally, catdoc checks if first
-               8 bytes of file is Microsoft OLE signature. If so, it processes
-               file,  otherwise  it just copies it to stdin. It is intended to
-               use catdoc as filter for viewing all files with .doc extension.
-
-       -dcharset
-               - specifies destination charset name. Charset file  has  format
-               described  in  CHARACTER SETS below and should have .txt extenâ
-               sion  and reside in  catdoc  library  directory  (  ${exec_preâ
-               fix}/lib/catdoc). By default, current locale charset is used if
-               langinfo support compiled in.
-
-       -fformat
-               - specifies output format as described in  CHARACTER  SUBSTITUâ
-               TION  below.   catdoc comes with two output formats - ascii and
-               tex. You can add your own if you wish.
-
-       -l      Causes catdoc to list names of available charsets to the stdout
-               and exit successfully.
-
-       -mnumber
-               Specifies right margin for text  (default 72).  -m 0 is equivaâ
-               lent to -w
-
-       -scharset
-               Specifies source charset. (one used in Word document), if  Word
-               document  doesn't  contain UTF-16  text. When reading rtf docuâ
-               ments, it is typically not  necessary,  because  rtf  documents
-               contain  ansicpg specification. But it can be set wrong by Word
-               (I've seen RTF documents on Russian, where  cp1252  was  speciâ
-               fied).  In  this  case  this  option would take precedence over
-               charset, specified in the document. But  source_charset  stateâ
-               ment  in the configuration file have less priority than charset
-               in the document.
-
-       -t      - shortcut for -f tex
-                converts all printable chars, which have special  meaning  for
-               LaTeX(1)  into  appropriate  control sequences. Separates table
-               columns by &.
-
-       -u      - declares that Word   document   contain   UNICODE    (UTF-16)
-               representation  of  text (as some Word-97 documents). If catdoc
-               fails to correct  Word document with   default  charset,    try
-               this  option.
-
-       -8      - declares is Word document is 8 bit. Just in case that catdoc
-                recognizes file format incorrectly.
-
-       -w      disables  word wrapping. By default catdoc output is split into
-               lines not longer than 72 (or  number, specified by -m   option)
-               characters  and  paragraphs  are  separated by blank line. With
-               this option each paragraph is one long line.
-
-       -x      causes catdoc to output unknown UNICODE  character  as  \xNNNN,
-               instead of question marks.
-
-       -v      causes catdoc to print some useless information about word docâ
-               ument structure to stdout before actual start of text.
-
-       -V      outputs catdoc version
-
-
-CHARACTER SETS
-       When processing MS-Word file catdoc uses information about two  characâ
-       ter sets, typically different
-        -   input  and  output.  They are stored in plain text files in catdoc
-       data directory. Character set files should contain two whitespace-sepaâ
-       rated hexadecimal numbers - 8-bit code in character set and 16-bit Uniâ
-       code code.  Anything from hash mark to end of line is ignored, as  well
-       as blank lines.
-
-       catdoc  distribution  includes some of these character sets. Additional
-       character set definitions, directly usable by catdoc  can  be  obtained
-       from  ftp.unicode.org.  Charset files have .txt suffix, which shouldn't
-       be specified in command-line or configuration files.
-
-       Note that catdoc is distributed with Cyrillic charsets as  default.  If
-       you  are not Russian, you probably don't want it, an should reconfigure
-       catdoc at compile time or in runtime configuration file.
-
-       When dealing with documents with charsets other than default,  remember
-       that  Microsoft  never  uses ISO charsets. While letters in, say cp1252
-       are at the same position as in ISO-8859-1, some punctuation signs would
-       be lost, if you specify ISO-8859-1 as input charset. If you use cp1252,
-       catdoc would deal with those signs as described in CHARACTER  SUBSTITUâ
-       TION below.
-
-
-CHARACTER SUBSTITUTION
-       catdoc converts  MS-Word file into following internal Unicode represenâ
-       tation:
-
-       1. Paragraphs are separated by ASCII Line Feed symbol (0x000A)
-
-       2. Table cells within row are separated by ASCII Field Separator symbol
-           (0x001C)
-
-       3. Table rows are separated by ASCII Record Separator (0x001E)
-
-       4. All printable characters, including whitespace are represented  with
-       their
-           respective UNICODE codes.
-
-       This  UNICODE  representation is subsequently converted into 8-bit text
-       in target character set using following four-step algorithm:
-
-       1. List of special characters is searched for given Unicode character.
-           If found,  then  appropriate  multi-character  sequence  is  output
-           instead of character.
-
-       2. If there is an equivalent in target character set, it is output.
-
-       3. Otherwise, replacement list is searched and, if there is multi-charâ
-       acter
-           substitution for this UNICODE char, it is output.
-
-       4. If all above fails, "Unknown char" symbol (question mark) is output.
-
-       Lists of special characters and list of substitution are character set-
-       independent,  because  special  chars  should  be escaped regardless of
-       their existence in target character set  (usually, they  are  parts  of
-       US-ASCII,  and  therefore  exist  in any character set) and replacement
-       list is searched only for those characters, which are not found in tarâ
-       get character set.
-
-       These lists are stored in catdoc data directory in files with prefix of
-       format name. These files have following format:
-
-       Each line can be either comment (starting with hash  mark)  or  contain
-       hexadecimal  UNICODE  value, separated by whitespace from string, which
-       would be substituted instead of it. If string contain no whitespace  it
-       can  be used as is, otherwise it should be enclosed in single or double
-       quotes. Usual backslash sequences like '\n','\t' can be used  in  these
-       string.
-
-
-
-RUNTIME CONFIGURATION
-       Upon  startup catdoc reads its system-wide configuration file /etc/catâ
-       docrc and then user-specific configuration file ${HOME}/.catdocrc.
-
-       These files can contain following directives:
-
-       source_charset = charset-name
-               Sets default source charset, which  would  be  used  if  no  -s
-               option specified. Consult configuration of nearby windows workâ
-               station to find one you need.
-
-       target_charset = charset-name
-                Sets default output charset. You probably know, which one  you
-               use.
-
-       charset_path = directory-list
-               colon-separated  list  of  directories,  which are searched for
-               charset files.  This allows you to install additional  charsets
-               in  your  home directory.  If first directory component of path
-               is ~ it is replaced by contents of HOME  environment  variable.
-               On  MS-DOS  platform,  if  directory name starts with %s, it is
-               replaced with directory of executable file.  Empty  element  in
-               list (i.e. two consequitve colons) is considered current direcâ
-               tory.
-
-       map_path = directory-list
-               colon-separated list of directories,  which  are  searched  for
-               special  character  map and replacement map.  Same substitution
-               rules as in charset_path are applied.
-
-       format = format name
-               Output format which would be used  by  default.   catdoc  comes
-               with  two formats - ascii and tex but nothing prevents you from
-               writing your own format (set two map files - special  character
-               map and replacement map).
-
-       unknown_char = character specification
-               sets  character  to output instead of unknown Unicode character
-               (default '?')  Character specification can have one of two form
-               - character enclosed in single quotes or hexadecimal code.
-
-       use_locale =(yes|no)
-               Enables  or  disables  automatic  selection  of  output charset
-               (default yes),
-                based on system locale settings (if enabled at compile  time).
-               If automatic detection is enabled, than output charset settings
-               in the configuration files (but not in the  command  line)  are
-               ignored,  and  current  system  locale charset is used instead.
-               There are no automatic choice of input charset, based of locale
-               language,  because  most  modern Word files (since Word 97) are
-               Unicode anyway
-
-
-BUGS
-       Doesn't handle fast-saves properly. Prints footnotes as separate  paraâ
-       graphs at the end of file, instead of producing correct LaTeX commands.
-       Cannot distinguish between empty table cell and end of table row.
