+
+ 1.4.6 conntrackd instances runnning on little-endian hosts are not
+ compatible with 1.4.7 instances.
+
+ Before 1.4.7, when syncing, conntrackd instances communicated NAT IP
+ addresses in host byte-order.  This meant that one could not run
+ instances on hosts of different endianness, because if the byte-orders
+ of the sending and receiving instances were different, the receiving
+ instance would get the addresses inverted: 10.0.0.1 -> 1.0.0.10.
+
+ In 1.4.7, conntrackd uses network byte-order.  Since network byte-order
+ is big-endian, all 1.4.7 instances are incompatible with 1.4.6 little-
+ endian instances.
