+Green hard drives are engineered to reduce power consumption.  To this
+end they park the drive heads after a period of inactivity.  At the
+time of this writing Western Digital Green drives have an idle timeout
+of 8 seconds.  Under the Linux kernel this results in excessive
+load/park cycles, drive wear, and premature drive failure.
+
+</para><para> The idle timeout of Western Digital Green drives can be
+permanently adjusted using proprietary software supplied by Western
+Digital that, at the time of this writing, runs only under MS-Dos.
+Alternately, the <command>hdparm</command> command's
+<command>-J</command> option can be used to temporarily adjust the
+idle timeout.  The <command>hdparm</command> developers recommend a 30
+second timeout.  The <command>idle3ctl</command> command is another
+Free Software option.  It permanently adjusts the idle timeout.
+
+</para><warning><para>
+The Western Digital Green drive firmware is proprietary and
+reverse-engineering is required to produce the Free Software that
+manipulates the idle timeout.  Consequently use of Free Software tools
+to modify the idle timeout, while they work for many at the time of
+this writing, might render your Western Digital Green drive
+inoperable.  The Free Software tools are used at your own risk.
