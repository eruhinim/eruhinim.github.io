+.TH SREBUILD 1 "\*[RELEASE_DATE]" "Version \*[VERSION]" "Debian sbuild"
+.SH NAME
+srebuild \- sbuild wrapper to make a reproducible build using a .buildinfo file
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B srebuild package.buildinfo
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+\fBsrebuild\fR is a thin wrapper around sbuild. Given a \fI.buildinfo\fP file,
+it first finds a timestamp of Debian Sid from snapshot.debian.org which
+contains the requested packages in their exact versions. It then runs sbuild
+with the right architecture as given by the .buildinfo file and the right base
+system to upgrade from, as given by the version of the base-files package
+version in the .buildinfo file. Using two hooks it will install the right
+package versions and verify that the installed packages are in the right
+version before the build starts.
+.SH OPTIONS
+There are no options yet.
+.SH BUGS
+\fBsrebuild\fR will give up if not all packages can be found in a single
+snapshot. It should be possible to retrieve the right packages from multiple
+timestamps.
+.PP
+Querying the snapshot.debian.org API for the right timestamp with the correct
+versions takes some time. It should be possible to manually supply the right
+timestamp on the command line, allowing to skip the step of figuring out the
+right timestamp. Conversely, every run should output the timestamp it found so
+that it can be used to skip the step for repeated runs.
+.PP
+The right snapshot is expected to be found in Debian sid, main. It should be
+possible to find it in stable and testing as well or even mix different suites.
+It should be possible to find the right packages in contrib and non free, too.
+Additionally, it might be worthwhiel to search debian-archive,
+debian-backports, debian-ports, debian-security or debian-volatile for the
+right version.
+.PP
+Currently, wheezy will always be used as the base. Instead, the version of the
+base-files package should be used to select the optimal release to upgrade
+from.
