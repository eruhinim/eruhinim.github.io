// Use ":set nowrap" to edit table

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System[X Window System] on the Debian system is based on the source from http://www.x.org/[X.Org].

=== Key packages

There are a few (meta)packages provided to ease installation.

For the basics of X, refer to [-`X`(7),-] {+`X`(7) and+} http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/XWindow-User-HOWTO.html[the LDP XWindow-User-HOWTO].

=== Setting up desktop environment

A http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment[desktop environment] is usually a combination of a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_window_manager[X window manager], a file manager, and a suite of compatible utility programs.

You can setup a full http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment[desktop environment] such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME[GNOME], http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE[KDE], http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce[Xfce], or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXDE[LXDE], from the `aptitude` under the task menu.

TIP: Task menu may be out of sync with the latest package transition state under Debian `unstable`/`testing` environment. In such situation, you need to deselect some (meta)packages listed under `aptitude`(8) task menu to avoid package conflicts.  When deselecting (meta)packages, you must select certain packages providing their dependencies manually to avoid them deleted automatically.

You may alternatively setup a simple environment manually just with a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_window_manager[X window manager] such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxbox[Fluxbox].

See http://www.xwinman.org[Window Managers for X] for the guide to the X window manager and the desktop environment.

==== Debian menu

http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/menu.html/[Debian menu system] provides a general interface for both text- and X-oriented programs with `update-menus`(1) from the `menu` package.  Each package installs its menu data in the "`/usr/share/menu/`" directory. See "`/usr/share/menu/README`".

==== Freedesktop.org menu

Each package which is compliant to Freedesktop.org@@@sq@@@s xdg menu system installs its menu data provided by "`\*.desktop`" under "`/usr/share/applications/`". Modern desktop environments which are compliant to Freedesktop.org standard use these data to generate their menu using the `xdg-utils` package.  See "`/usr/share/doc/xdg-utils/README`".

==== Debian menu from Freedesktop.org menu

In order to access [-to-] the traditional Debian menu from the http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/menu-spec/[Freedesktop.org menu] compliant window manager environment such as GNOME and KDE, you must install the `menu-xdg` package.

=== The server/client relationship

The X Window System is activated as a combination of the server and client programs. The meaning for the words **server** and **client** with respect to the words **local** and **remote** requires attention here.

.List of server/client terminology
[grid="all"]
`----------------------`-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
type                   description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**X server**           a program run on a **local host** connected to the user@@@sq@@@s display and input devices.
**X client**           a program run on a **remote host** that processes data and talks to the X server.
**application server** a program run on a **remote host** that processes data and talks to the {+application+} clients.
**application client** a program run on a **local host** connected to the user@@@sq@@@s display and input devices.
{+### HW: To make sure, that the third line is understood correctly, I would add the
### HW: "application" there. Otherwise one might understand it as: "the application server 
### HW: talks to the X client" {which I think was not meant here, right?} because the 
### HW: X client is mentioned in the line before (line 2) and when you read it from the 
### HW: top to the bottom ...+}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern X servers have http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT-SHM[the MIT Shared Memory Extension] and communicate with their local X clients using the local shared memory.  This bypasses the network transparent Xlib interprocess communication channel and gains performance for large images.

=== The X server

See `xorg`(1) for X server information.

==== The (re)configuration of the X server

NOTE: X server (post-`lenny`) is rewritten to use more information from standardized OS services such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_(software)[HAL] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus[D-bus], for its configuration than that from "`/etc/X11/xorg.conf`".  So contents in "`/etc/X11/xorg.conf`" are getting less.  You may need to http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/InputHotplugGuide[work around transitional problems of X server].

The following (re)configures an X server by generating a new "`/etc/X11/xorg.conf`" file using `dexconf`(1).

--------------------
# dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low x11-common
# dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low xserver-xorg
--------------------

If you have manually edited this "`/etc/X11/xorg.conf`" file but would like it to be automatically updated again, run the following command.

-----
# sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
-----

Please check your X configuration  with respect to the specification of your monitor carefully.  For the large high resolution CRT monitor, it is a good idea to set the refresh rate as high as your monitor can handle (85 Hz is great, 75 Hz is OK) to reduce flicker.  For the LCD monitor, slower standard refresh rate (60Hz) is usually fine due to its slow response.

NOTE: Be careful not to use too high refresh rate which may cause fatal hardware failure of your monitor system.

==== The connection methods to the X server

There are several ways of getting the "X server" (**display** side) to accept connections from an "X client" (**application** side).

WARNING:  Do not use remote http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol[TCP]/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol[IP] connection over **unsecured** network for X connection unless you have very good reason such as use of encryption.  A remote TCP/IP socket connection without encryption is prone to the **eavesdropping attack** and is disabled by default on the Debian system.  Use "`ssh -X`".

WARNING:  Do not use http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager[XDMCP connection] over **unsecured** network either.  It sends data via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol[UDP]/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol[IP] without encryption and is prone to the **eavesdropping attack**.

TIP: LTSP stands for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Terminal_Server_Project[Linux Terminal Server Project].

=== Starting the X Window System

The X Window System is usually started as an http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_session_manager[X session] which is the combination of an X server and connecting X clients.  For the normal desktop system, both of them are executed on a workstation.

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_session_manager[X session] is started by {+one of+} the following.

- `startx` command started from the command line
- One of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager[X display manager] daemon programs `\*dm` started from the end of the start up script in "`/etc/rc?.d/`" ("`?`" corresponding to the runlevel) directory

TIP: The start up script for the display manager daemons checks the content of the "`/etc/X11/default-display-manager`" file before actually executing themselves.  This ensures to have only one http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager[X display manager] daemon program activated.

TIP: See <<_specific_locale_only_under_x_window>> for initial environment variables of the X display manager.

Essentially, all these programs execute the "`/etc/X11/Xsession`" script.  Then the "`/etc/X11/Xsession`" script performs `run-parts`(8) like action to execute scripts in the "`/etc/X11/Xsession.d/`" directory. This is essentially an execution of [-a-] {+the+} first program which is found in the following order [-with-] {+by+} the `exec` builtin command.

1. The script specified as the argument of "`/etc/X11/Xsession`" by the X display manager, if it is defined.
2. The "`\~/.xsession`" or "`\~/.Xsession`" script, if it is defined.
3. The "`/usr/bin/x-session-manager`" command, if it is defined.
4. The "`/usr/bin/x-window-manager`" command, if it is defined.
5. The "`/usr/bin/x-terminal-emulator`" command, if it is defined.

This process is affected by the content of "`/etc/X11/Xsession.options`".  The exact programs to which these "`/usr/bin/x-\*`" commands point, are determined by the Debian [-alternative-] {+alternatives+} system and changed by "`update-alternatives --config x-session-manager`", etc.

==== Starting X session with gdm3

`gdm3`(1) lets you select the session type (or desktop environment: <<_setting_up_desktop_environment>>), and language (or locale: <<_the_locale>>) of the X session from its menu.  It keeps the selected default value in "`\~/.dmrc`" as the following.

--------------------
[Desktop]
Session=default
Language=ja_JP.UTF-8
--------------------

==== Customizing the X session (classic method)

On a system where "`/etc/X11/Xsession.options`" contains a line "`allow-user-xsession`" without preceding "`#`" characters, any user who defines "`\~/.xsession`" or "`\~/.Xsession`" is able to customize the action of "`/etc/X11/Xsession`" by completely overriding the system code. The last command in the "`\~/.xsession`" file should use form of "`exec some-window/session-manager`" to start your favorite X window/session managers.

==== Customizing the X session (new method)

Here are new methods to customize the X session without completely overriding the system code as above.

- The display manager `gdm3` can select a specific session and set it as the argument of "`/etc/X11/Xsession`".
- The "`\~/.xsessionrc`" file is executed as a part of start up process. (desktop independent)
- The "`\~/.gnomerc`" file is executed as a part of start up process. (GNOME desktop only)
- The GUI program based session management software may use the "`\~/.gnome2/session`" file etc.

==== Connecting a remote X client via SSH

The use of "`ssh -X`" enables a secure connection from a local X server to a remote application server.

Set "`X11Forwarding`" entries to "`yes`" in "`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`" of the remote host, if you want to avoid "`-X`" command-line option.

Start the X server on the local host.

Open an `xterm` in the local host.

Run `ssh`(1) to establish a connection with the remote site as the following.

--------------------
localname @ localhost $ ssh -q -X loginname@remotehost.domain
Password:
--------------------

Run an X application command, e.g. "`gimp`", on the remote site as the following.

--------------------
loginname @ remotehost $ gimp &
--------------------

This method can display the output from a remote X client as if it were locally connected through a local UNIX domain socket.

==== Secure X terminal via the Internet

Secure X terminal via the Internet, which displays remotely run entire X desktop environment, can easily achieved by using specialized package such as `ldm`. Your local machine becomes a secure thin client to the remote application server connected via SSH.

=== Fonts in the X Window

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontconfig[Fontconfig 2.0] was created to provide a distribution independent library for configuring and customizing font access in 2002.  Debian after `squeeze` uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontconfig[Fontconfig 2.0] for its font configuration.

Font supports on X Window System can be summarized as follows.

- Legacy X server side font support system
 * The original core X11 font system provides backward compatibility for older version of X client applications.
 * The original core X11 fonts are installed on the X server.
- Modern X client side font support system
 * [-Modern-] {+The modern+} X system supports all fonts listed below (<<_basic_fonts>>, <<_additional_fonts>>, and <<_cjk_fonts>>) with advanced features such as anti-aliasing.
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xft[Xft] 2.0 connects modern X applications such as ones from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME[GNOME], http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE[KDE], and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice[LibreOffice] with http://freetype.sourceforge.net/index.html[FreeType] 2.0 library.
 * http://freetype.sourceforge.net/index.html[FreeType] 2.0 provides font rasterization library.
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontconfig[Fontconfig] provides resolution of the font specification for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xft[Xft] 2.0.  See `fonts.conf`(5) for its configuration.
 * All modern X applications using http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xft[Xft] 2.0 can talk to modern X server using the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRender[X Rendering Extension].
 * The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRender[X Rendering Extension] moves font access and glyph image generation from the X server to the X client.

You can check font configuration information by the following.

- "`xset q`" for core X11 font path
- "`fc-match`" for fontconfig font default
- "`fc-list`" for available fontconfig fonts

TIP: "http://unifont.org/iuc27/html/ICUPresentation.html[The Penguin and Unicode]" is a good overview of modern X Window System. Other documentations at http://unifont.org/[http://unifont.org/] should provide good information on Unicode fonts, Unicode-enabled software, internationalization, and Unicode usability issues on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software[free/libre/open source (FLOSS)] operating systems.

==== Basic fonts

There are 2 major types of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_font[computer fonts].

- Bitmap fonts (good for low resolution rasterization)
- Outline/stroke fonts (good for high resolution rasterization)

While scaling of bitmap fonts causes jugged image, scaling of outline/stroke fonts produces smooth image.

Bitmap fonts on the Debian system are usually provided by compressed http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/pcf-format.html[X11 pcf bitmap font files] having their file extension "`.pcf.gz`".

Outline fonts on the Debian system are provided by the following.

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript[PostScript] Type 1 font files having their file extension "`.pfb`" (binary font file) and "`.afm`" (font metrics file).
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType[TrueType] (or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType[OpenType]) font files usually having their file extension "`.ttf`".

TIP: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType[OpenType] is intended to supersede both http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType[TrueType] and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript[PostScript] Type 1.

==== Additional fonts

`aptitude`(8) helps you find additional fonts easily.

// defoma removed: - The short package list under "Packages which depend on defoma" in the `defoma` package list

- The short package list under "Tasks" ->  "Localization"
- The filtered flat package list of font data with regex on debtag: "`\~Gmade-of::data:font`"
- The filtered flat package list of the BDF (bitmap) font packages with regex on package name: "`\~nxfonts-`"
- The filtered flat package list of the TrueType (outline) font packages with regex on package name: "`\~nttf-|\~nfonts-`"

Since **Free** fonts are sometimes limited, installing or sharing some commercial TrueType fonts is an option for a Debian users.  In order to make this process easy for the user, some convenience packages have been created.

- `mathematica-fonts`
- `fonts-mscorefonts-installer`

You'll have a really good selection of TrueType fonts at the expense of contaminating your **Free** system with non-Free fonts.

==== CJK fonts

Here are some key points focused on fonts of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJK_characters[CJK characters].

.Table of key words used in CJK font names to indicate font types
[grid="all"]
`----------`--------------------`-----------------`--------------------
font type  Japanese font name   Chinese font name Korean font name
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
sans-serif gothic, ã´ããã¯         hei, gothic       dodum, gulim, gothic
serif      mincho, ææ           song, ming        batang
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

// It seems Japanese wide characters are counted as one char.

Font name such as "VL PGothic" with "P" is a proportional font which corresponds to the fixed width "VL Gothic" font.

For example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_JIS[Shift_JIS] code table comprises 7070 characters.  They can be grouped as the following.

- JIS X 0201 single-byte characters (191 characters, a.k.a. half-width characters)
- JIS X 0208 double-byte characters (6879 characters, a.k.a. full-width characters)

Double-byte characters occupy double width on console terminals which uses CJK fixed width fonts.  In order to cope with such situation, http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/packages/ccic/software/info/HBF-1.1/[Hanzi Bitmap Font (HBF) File] with file extension "`.hbf`" may be deployed for fonts containing single-byte and double-byte characters.

In order to save space for http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType[TrueType] font files, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType[TrueType] font collection file with file extension "`.ttc`" may be used.

In order to cover complicated code space of characters, CID keyed http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript[PostScript] Type 1 font is used with CMap files starting themselves with "`%!PS-Adobe-3.0 Resource-CMap`".  This is rarely used for normal X display but used for PDF rendering etc. (see <<_x_utility_applications>>).

TIP: The multiple http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph[glyphs] are expected for some http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode[Unicode] code points due to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification[Han unification].  One of the most annoying ones are  "U+3001 IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA" and "U+3002 IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP" whose character positions differ among CJK countries.  Configuring priority of Japanese centric fonts over Chinese ones using "`\~/.fonts.conf`" should give peace of minds to Japanese.

CAUTION: The `poppler-data` package (previously non-free, see <<_ghostscript>>) needs to be installed for `evince` and `okular` to display CJK PDF documents using Cmap data (<<_cjk_fonts>>).

NOTE: Installing softwares such as `scribus` (KDE) on GNOME desktop environment are quite acceptable since corresponding functionality is not available under GNOME desktop environment.  But installing too many packages with duplicated functionalities clutter your menu.

=== The X trivia

==== Keymaps and pointer button mappings in X

`xmodmap`(1) is a utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in the X Window System.
To get the **keycode**, run `xev`(1) in the X and press keys.  To get the meaning of **keysym**, look into the MACRO definition in "`/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h`" file (`x11proto-core-dev` package).  All "`#define`" statements in this file are named as "`XK_`" prepended to **keysym** names.

==== Classic X clients

Most traditional X client programs, such as `xterm`(1), can be started with a set of standard command line options to specify geometry, font, and display.

They also use the X resource database to configure their appearance.  The system-wide defaults of X resources are stored in "`/etc/X11/Xresources/\*`" and application defaults of them are stored in "`/etc/X11/app-defaults/\*`".  Use these settings as the starting points.

The "`\~/.Xresources`" file is used to store user resource specifications.  This file is automatically merged into the default X resources upon login.  To make changes to these settings and make them effective immediately, merge them into the database using the following command.

--------------------
$ xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources
--------------------

See `x`(7) and `xrdb`(1).

==== The X terminal emulator â xterm

Learn everything about `xterm`(1) at http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.faq.html[http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.faq.html].

==== Running X clients as root

WARNING: Never start the X display/session manager under the root account by typing in `root` to the prompt of the display manager such as `gdm3` because it is considered unsafe (insecure), even when you plan to perform administrative activities.  The entire X architecture is considered insecure if run as root.  You must always use the lowest privilege level possible, like a regular user account.

Easy ways to run a particular X client, e.g. "`foo`" as root is to use `sudo`(8) etc. as the following.

--------------------
$ sudo foo &
--------------------

--------------------
$ sudo -s
# foo &
--------------------

--------------------
$ gksu foo &
--------------------

--------------------
$ ssh -X root@localhost
# foo &
--------------------

CAUTION: Use of `ssh`(1) just for this purpose as above is waste of resource.

In order for the X client to connect to the X server, please note the following.

- Values of the old user@@@sq@@@s "`$XAUTHORITY`" and "`$DISPLAY`" environment variables must be copied to the new user@@@sq@@@s ones.
- The file pointed by value of the "`$XAUTHORITY`" environment variable must be readable by the new user.

The `gksu` package (popcon: @-@pop-gksu@-@) is a specialized GTK+ GUI package for gaining the root privileges.  It can be configured to use `su`(1) or `sudo`(8) as its backend depending on the "`/apps/gksu/sudo-mode`" gconf key.  You can edit gconf key using `gconf-editor`(1) (menu: "Applications" -> "System Tools" -> "Configuration Editor").
