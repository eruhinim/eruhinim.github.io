 dependencies
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
-dh_python3 tries to translate Python dependencies from requires.txt file to
-Debian dependencies. Use debian/py3dist-overrides or --no-guessing-deps option
-to override it if the guess is incorrect. If you want dh_python3 to generate
-more strict dependencies (f.e. to avoid ABI problems) create
-debian/python3-foo.pydist file. See /usr/share/doc/dh-python/README.PyDist
-for more information. If the pydist file contains PEP386 flag or set of (uscan
-like) rules, dh_python3 will make the depedency versioned (version requirements
-are ignored by default).

+dh_python3 tries to translate Python dependencies from requires.txt
+file to Debian dependencies. Use debian/py3dist-overrides
+or --no-guessing-deps option to override it if the guess is
+incorrect. Dependencies are not versioned by default. If you want
+dh_python3 to generate more strict dependencies (f.e. to avoid ABI
+problems) on your package, you can create a debian/python3-foo.pydist
+file. This file will be installed in
+`/usr/share/dh-python/dist/cpython3/binary_pkg_name`, and other
+packages using dh_python3 will use it to determine the correct
+dependency on `binary_pkg_name` during build. If the pydist file
+contains a PEP386 flag or set of (uscan like) rules, dh_python3 will
+make the dependency versioned. See
+`/usr/share/doc/dh-python/README.PyDist` for more information.
