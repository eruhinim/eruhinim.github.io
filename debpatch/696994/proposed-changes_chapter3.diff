 Of course, these can be configured differently.  For example, if you compiled your own kernel, you may be skipping the step with the mini-Debian system.  So please do not assume this is the case for your system until you check it yourself.

 The normal Debian system is the 4th stage of the boot process which is started by the mini-Debian system.  The system kernel for the mini-Debian system continues to run in this environment. The root filesystem is switched from the one on the memory to the one on the real hard disk filesystem. 
 
-The "`/sbin/init`" program is executed as the first program and performs the main boot process. The Debian normally uses the traditional sysvinit scheme with the `sysv-rc` package.
