+_Description: Backup file name for /etc/sasldb2:
+ Cyrus SASL has stored usernames and passwords in the database file
+ /etc/sasldb2. That file has to be upgraded to a newer database
+ format. Before doing that, we will make a backup of the current file.
+ You can use that if you need to manually downgrade Cyrus SASL for
+ some reason. Note that automatic downgrade is NOT SUPPORTED.
+ .
+ Please specify the backup file name. The default is /var/backups/sasldb2.bak.
+ Make sure you have enough free space in that location, and that a file
+ with that name doesn't exist already. If it exists, it will be overwritten.
+ An empty name selects the default.
