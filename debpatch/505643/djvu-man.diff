 DjVuPhoto files are logically composed of a sequence of "slices" containing
 successive image refinements.  Slices are grouped in "chunks" defining the
 progressive rendering sequence.  The viewer is able to display an intermediate
 image after processing each chunk.  A typical DjVuPhoto files contains 80 to
 120 slices grouped into 1 to 4 chunks.
