 .IP "EXTLINUX_THEME=""\fBdebian\fR""" 4
 This variable specifies the theme that should be used, e.g. to display a graphical boot menu. Values are either the name of an EXTLINUX theme installed in /usr/share/syslinux/themes, or the full path to the theme. If no theme should be used, the value 'none' can be used. If no theme is specified and themes are not disabled through 'none', and if /usr/share/syslinux/themes/debian is available, then it defaults to that, otherwise the default is empty and no theme is used. For more information about how to install the themes package, see /usr/share/doc/extlinux/README.Debian.
