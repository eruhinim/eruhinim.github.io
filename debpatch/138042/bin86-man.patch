+.SH NAME
+ar86 \- Create, modify, and extract from archive file
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B ar86
+.I operation
+.B archive 
+.RI [ file... ]
+.PP
+.BR ar86
+.I positional\-op
+.B  member
+.B archive 
+.RI [ file ...]
+
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+The 
+.B ar86 
+program is used to create, examine and modify archive files produced
+by the Dev86/ELKS toolchain.
+.SH OPTIONS
+The 
+.B ar86
+command requires that the operation to be performed on the archive be
+specified as the first option. If the operation is positional then the
+next option is the archive member marking the position. This is
+followed by the archive file name and any list of file names.
+.PP
+.SS Operations
+One of the following operations can be specified
+.TP
+.B d
+\fIdelete\fR the listed files from the archive.
+.TP
+.B m
+\fImove\fR the named files. By default files are moved to the end of
+the archive unless a positional modifier is present.
+.TP
+.B p
+\fIprint\fP the contents of archive members to standard out. If a file
+list is included only those members are printed. If the \fBv\fR
+modifier is present each file's contents are preceeded by a new line,
+a line with the string \fBmember\fR, a space character, the member
+name, and two following newlines.
+.TP
+.B q
+.I quickly
+add the files to the end of the archive without checking
+to see if they already exist in the archive. This operation will
+ignore any positional modifiers. Creates the archive file if it does
+not exist.
+.TP
+.B r
+\fIreplace\fR archive members with the files listed. If the file name
+is not present in the archive it is added to the end of the archive
+(or to any explicitly specified position). Creates the archive file if
+it does not exist.
+.TP
+.B t
+\fItable\fR; list the file names of archive members. If a file list is
+present only those files that are present in the archive are listed.
+The \fBv\fR modifier prints member attributes.
+.TP
+.B x
+\fIextract\fR the named files from the archive into the current
+directory. If no files are specified all the archive members will be
+extracted.
+.P
+.SS Modifiers
+The following modifiers may be used with the operations
+.TP
+.B o
+\fIoriginal\fR time stamps from the archive are preserved for
+extracted files when possible.
+.TP
+.B s
+\fIsymbol\fR update; this option may be used by itself to force an
+update to the symbol definition section of the archive (the
+.B __.SYMDEF
+member). If any files are specified they will be replaced as if the 
+.B r
+operation had been specified. If no symbol definition section exists
+one is created. This option will also creates the archive file if it
+does not exist.
+.TP
+.B u 
+\fIupdate\fR files in the archive during a
+.B r
+.RI ( replace )
+operation. The files are added to the archive in exactly the same
+manner as
+.I replace
+except that an existing archive member will be retained (in its
+original position) if it has a modified more recently than the file
+being added. Note that this modifier acts as if a
+.B r
+operation has been specified (even it has not), and will actually
+override any other previously specified operation.
+.TP
+.B v
+\fIverbose\fR; print additional diagnostic messages while processing
+the archive.
+.SS Positional Modifiers
+The following modifiers specify where in the archive files are moved
+to or added. If any of these modifiers are specified then the second
+option to 
+.B ar86
+must be the name of an archive member.
+.TP
+.B a
+\fIafter\fR; files are placed after the specified archive member.
+.TP
+.B b
+\fIbefore\fR; files are placed before the specified archive member.
+.TP
+.B i
+same as
+.BR b .
+.SH EXAMPLES
+To see the contents of an archive
+.IP
+ar86 tv libfile.a
+.PP
+To add some files to an archive
+.IP
+ar86 r libfile.a file1.o file2.o
+.PP
+to add some files after a member named mem.o and to update the symbol
+table 
+.IP
+ar86 rsa mem.o libfile.a file1.o file2.o
+.SH BUGS
+A 
+.B l
+modifier will be accepted but ignored.
+.SH RESTRICTIONS
+This command is intended for use only with object files created using
+the Dev86/ELKS toolchain.

+.SH SYNOPSIS

+.RI [ file ...]
+.PP
+.BI nm86 
+.RI [ file ...]
+
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+These commands are used to examine the contents of object files. They
+may also be used to examine archive or executable files. When archive
+files are examined each module in the archive will be processed in
+sequence.
+.PP
+.B nm86 
+prints the symbol table in each of the specified files.
+.PP
+.B size86
+displays a summary of the sizes of the segments in each of the files.
+.PP
+.B objdump86
+decodes and displays the contents of the object files specified. This
+includes the section headers, symbols tables, segment sizes, and
+segment contents.
+.SH OPTIONS
+The programs are not designed to accept any options.
+.PP
+It should be noted that all three of
+.BR objdump86 ,
+.BR size86 ,
+and 
+.B nm86
+are implemented as links to the same executable file (called
+.BR objdump86
+in the source distribution). The result of running this executable is
+determined by the file name actually used to execute it.
+.PP
+It is possible to force a specific behavior irrespective of the
+invocation file name using one of the options below
+.TP
+.B -s
+Behave like
+.BR size86 .
+.TP
+.B -n
+Behave like
+.BR nm86 .
+.SH RESTRICTIONS
+These commands are intended for use only with the Dev86/ELKS
+toolchain.
