Description: Fix effect dialog segfault due to events before initialization
 Both the LV2EffectDialog and the VampEffectDialog receive EVT_TEXT events
 before they are properly initialized. To prevent this, a workaround was
 already in place, but was only active on Windows. Activated the workaround
 for wxGTK with wxWidgets >= 3.0, too.
