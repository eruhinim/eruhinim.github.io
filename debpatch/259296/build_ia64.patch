+ 7fï¿½70    There are four ways to install Debian from this CD. You can install     ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70    with either a 2.4 series kernel or the new 2.6 kernel.  Expert mode     ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70    gives you more control over the configuration of the system by          ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70    giving you the option to change configuration parameters and control    ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70    which packages are loaded.  Normal mode installs the default set of     ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70    packages and automatically configures them with the default settings.   ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70                                                                            ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70    The 2.4 series Linux kernels are appropriate in existing environments   ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70    where Linux 2.4 is already in production on other systems.  The 2.6     ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70    kernel series is more appropriate for environments where the new        ï¿½10
+ 7fï¿½70    functions and performance improvements are more important than          ï¿½10
